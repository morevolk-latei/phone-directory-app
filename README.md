# phone-directory-app
This is the sample phone directory app in react/redux

## To run the app download the code and then inside project root run command
```bash
yarn/npm install
```

### After installing dependencies run command
```js
yarn/npm start
```

### wait for a time to let webpack finish bundling then open the url (http://localhost:8082) in your browser

#### I have tried to make things simpler and on the same side with good practices.
#### technologies used in this app are
* React
* Redux
* Webpack
* babel
* eslint
* ES6
* material UI

> Go ahead and make youself familier with the UI.
 Rest I believe that always there is a room for learning, implementing and improving.

```js
console.greeting('Have a nice day. happy Coding!')
```
may the force be with you.
